Day 1 - ReactJS template, Github
-------------------------------
install VSC and setup `code` command
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac

pop open the terminal, orient yourself(pwd/ls): re-create the code folder

change directories into the code folder

create a new reactjs app by running the command `npx create-react-app helloworld`
-if there are errors we will need to install nodeJS ? i think, will google later

run ls to double check the project was created.
open this project in the `Microsoft Visual Studios Code` text editor by running the `code` command
`code helloworld`
minimize VSC for now

jump into the project folder using cd, run `ls` and checkout the contents

start the app up as a local website on your laptop.
`npm run start` -within the project folder, right where you are.

congrats! this is your 1st app! its just a template, but its a huge step forward.

we will now start to customize this website with a "hello world" statement.

re-open VSC. poke around at the files for a bit. then go to `SRC > APP.js`
within here we will delete everything between the top and bottom divs
<div>
...
</div>

Within the HTML div; write "Nikki is a MFin' BOSS"

<div>
Nikki is a MF'in BOSS
</div>

-----------
now change the HTML to show the text within a heading.
to do this, add <h1></h1> to the text like so

<div>
	<h1>
	Nikki is a MF'in BOSS
	</h1>
</div>

Fuck yeah, good job!
Now we can jump into some CSS(styling) and mess with ReactJS components
